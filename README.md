# **Cielo Payment Magento Module - Fillipe Almeida Dutra**

This module integrates Magento with a Cielo Web Serive payment gateway, without intermediator payment gateway, making the taxes less expensive. See more here: http://querycommerce.com/modulo-de-integracao-magento-cielo.html It enables payment with credit and debit cards, accepting Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Dinerns Club, Discover and Elo. That module permits the use of the modalities Buy Page Loja and Buy Page Cielo, automatic and manual capture of the transaction, card secure authentication, installments customization (installments number, interest tax rate, minimum value for an installment) and choice of a SoftDescriptor. This module was developed by Fillipe Almeida Dutra and tested together with the Brazilian Magento Community users.
